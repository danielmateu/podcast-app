This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install all the dependencies with:

```
npm i
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

# Installations 

- Tailwindcss, postcss and autoprefixer for a fast design
- Axios but finally I used the fetchApi
- mini-css-extract-plugin terser-webpack-plugin css-minimizer-webpack-plugin (for developer and production configuration)

````
I have created the application with nextjs because the creation of dynamic pages is clearer and easier for me, although it is true that I have had problems when performing the corresponding fetching, it has been very motivating to perform this practice.`
